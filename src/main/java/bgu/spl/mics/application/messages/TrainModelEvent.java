    Sent by the Student, this event is at the core of the system. It will
    be processed by one of the GPU microservices. diagram:
    -student send msgBus data to process
    -msgBus send data to GPU
    -GPU divides data into dataBatches each containing 1000 samples
    -while (theres data not processed):
        -if (GPU has room according to its type to store another dataBatch):
            -send cluster dataBatch (send cluster request to use CPU)
    -set TrainModelEvent result: complete.
